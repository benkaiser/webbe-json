David grew\nstronger and stronger, but Saul’s house grew weaker and weaker.\nSons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam\nthe Jezreelitess;\nand his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and\nthe third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;\nand the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah\nthe son of Abital;\nand the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David\nin Hebron.\nWhile there was war between Saul’s house and David’s house, Abner\nmade himself strong in Saul’s house.\nNow Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah;\nand Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”\nThen Abner was very angry about Ishbosheth’s words, and said, “Am\nI a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to your father Saul’s house, to his brothers,\nand to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with\na fault concerning this woman!\nGod do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the LORD has sworn to David,\nI don’t do even so to him:\nto transfer the kingdom from Saul’s house, and to set up David’s throne\nover Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.”\nHe could not answer Abner another word, because he was afraid\nof him.\nAbner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “Whose\nis the land?” and saying, “Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand will be with you to bring all\nIsrael around to you.”\nDavid said, “Good. I will make a treaty with you, but one thing\nI require of you. That is, you will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when\nyou come to see my face.”\nDavid sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me\nmy wife Michal, whom I was given to marry for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”\nIshbosheth sent and took her from her husband, Paltiel the son\nof Laish.\nHer husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim.\nThen Abner said to him, “Go! Return!” and he returned.\nAbner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “In\ntimes past, you sought for David to be king over you.\nNow then do it! For the LORD has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand\nof my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand\nof all their enemies.’”\nAbner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also\nto speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin.\nSo Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made\nAbner and the men who were with him a feast.\nAbner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel\nto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your\nsoul desires.” David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.\nBehold, David’s servants and Joab came from a raid and brought\nin a great plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he\nhad gone in peace.\nWhen Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab,\n“Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”\nThen Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold,\nAbner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is already gone?\nYou know Abner the son of Ner. He came to deceive you, and to know your\ngoing out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.”\nWhen Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner,\nand they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it.\nWhen Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle\nof the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died for the blood\nof Asahel his brother.\nAfterward, when David heard it, he said, “I and my kingdom are guiltless\nbefore the LORD forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.\nLet it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house. Let there\nnot fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or\nwho falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”\nSo Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed\ntheir brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.\nDavid said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear\nyour clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn in front of Abner.” King David followed\nthe bier.\nThey buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept\nat Abner’s grave; and all the people wept.\nThe king lamented for Abner, and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?\nYour hands weren’t bound, and your feet weren’t put into fetters. As\na man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.”\nAll the people wept again over him.\nAll the people came to urge David to eat bread while it was yet day;\nbut David swore, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else, until the\nsun goes down.”\nAll the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as whatever\nthe king did pleased all the people.\nSo all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not\nof the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.\nThe king said to his servants, “Don’t you know that a prince and a great\nman has fallen today in Israel?\nI am weak today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah\nare too hard for me. May the LORD reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.”\n","translation_id":"webbe","translation_name":"World English Bible, British Edition","translation_note":"Public Domain"}
