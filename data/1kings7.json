He came to King Solomon and performed all his work.\nFor he fashioned the two pillars of bronze, eighteen cubits high apiece;\nand a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them.\nHe made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars.\nThe height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.\nThere were nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the capitals\nwhich were on the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.\nSo he made the pillars; and there were two rows of pomegranates around\nthe one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and he did so for the other\ncapital.\nThe capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of\nlily work, four cubits.\nThere were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly\nwhich was beside the network.

The weight of the bronze could not be determined.\nSolomon made all the vessels that were in the LORD’s house: the\ngolden altar and the table that the show bread was on, of gold;\nand the lamp stands, five on the right side and five on the left, in\nfront of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;\nthe cups, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans, of\npure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors\nof the house, of the temple, of gold.\nThus all the work that King Solomon did in the LORD’s house was\nfinished.
