Therefore the king of Assyria seized him, and bound him in prison.\nThen the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, went up to\nSamaria, and besieged it three years.\nIn the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried\nIsrael away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities\nof the Medes.\nIt was so because the children of Israel had sinned against the\nLORD their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt,\nand had feared other gods,\nand walked in the statutes of the nations whom the LORD cast out from\nbefore the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.\nThe children of Israel secretly did things that were not right against\nthe LORD their God; and they built high places for themselves in all their cities, from the tower of the\nwatchmen to the fortified city;\nand they set up for themselves pillars and Asherah poles on every high\nhill and under every green tree;\nand there they burnt incense in all the high places, as the nations\nwhom the LORD carried away before them did; and they did wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger;\nand they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, “You shall\nnot do this thing.”\nYet the LORD testified to Israel and to Judah, by every prophet and\nevery seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to\nall the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”\nNotwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck like\nthe neck of their fathers who didn’t believe in the LORD their God.\nThey rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their\nfathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and\nfollowed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they should\nnot do like them.\nThey abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made\nmolten images for themselves, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the army of the\nsky, and served Baal.\nThey caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire,\nused divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, to\nprovoke him to anger.\nTherefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out\nof his sight. There was none left but the tribe of Judah only.\nAlso Judah didn’t keep the commandments of the LORD their God,\nbut walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.\nThe LORD rejected all the offspring of Israel, afflicted them, and\ndelivered them into the hands of raiders, until he had cast them out of his sight.\nFor he tore Israel from David’s house; and they made Jeroboam the son\nof Nebat king; and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.\nThe children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he\ndid; they didn’t depart from them\nuntil the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he said by all his\nservants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.\nThe king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, from Cuthah,\nfrom Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children\nof Israel; and they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities.\nSo it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t\nfear the LORD.

Therefore\nhe has sent lions amongst them; and behold, they kill them, because they don’t know the law of the god\nof the land.”\nThen the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one\nof the priests whom you brought from there; and let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.”\nSo one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria\ncame and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.\nHowever every nation made gods of their own, and put them in\nthe houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they\nlived.\nThe men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal,\nand the men of Hamath made Ashima,\nand the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their\nchildren in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\nSo they feared the LORD, and also made from amongst themselves priests\nof the high places for themselves, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.\nThey feared the LORD, and also served their own gods, after the ways\nof the nations from amongst whom they had been carried away.\nTo this day they do what they did before. They don’t fear the LORD,\nand they do not follow the statutes, or the ordinances, or the law, or the commandment which the LORD\ncommanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;\nwith whom the LORD had made a covenant and commanded them, saying,\n“You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;\nbut you shall fear the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of\nEgypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you shall\nsacrifice to him.\nThe statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment which\nhe wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever more. You shall not fear other gods.\nYou shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall\nnot fear other gods.\nBut you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out of\nthe hand of all your enemies.”\nHowever they didn’t listen, but they did what they did before.\nSo these nations feared the LORD, and also served their engraved images.\nTheir children did likewise, and so did their children’s children. They do as their fathers did to this\nday.\n","translation_id":"webbe","translation_name":"World English Bible, British Edition","translation_note":"Public Domain"}
